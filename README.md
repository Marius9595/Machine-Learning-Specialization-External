#BreakIntoAI with Machine Learning Specialization. Master fundamental AI concepts and develop practical machine learning skills in the beginner-friendly, 3-course program by AI visionary Andrew Ng

## [Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
If you want to break into cutting-edge AI, this course will help you do so. Deep learning engineers are highly sought after, and mastering deep learning will give you numerous new career opportunities. Deep learning is also a new “superpower” that will let you build AI systems that just weren’t possible a few years ago.

### In the first course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:
- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression

### [Week 1](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Course1/Week1)
- Learn the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning and regression and classification tasks.
- Build a linear regression model.
- Implement and understand the purpose of a cost function.
- Implement and understand how gradient descent is used to train a machine learning model.

### [Week 2](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Course1/Week2)
- Build and train a regression model that takes multiple features as input (multiple linear regression).
- Implement and understand the cost function and gradient descent for multiple linear regression.
- Implement and understand methods for improving machine learning models by choosing the learning rate, plotting the learning curve, performing feature engineering, and - applying polynomial regression.

### [Week 3](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Course1/Week3)
- Implement and understand the logistic regression model for classification.
- Learn why logistic regression is better suited for classification tasks than the linear regression model is.
- Implement and understand the cost function and gradient descent for logistic regression.
- Understand the problem of “overfitting” and improve model performance using regularization.
- Implement regularization to improve both regression and classification models.

### In the second course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:
- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.
- Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.
- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees.

### [Week 1](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Course2/Week1)
- Build a neural network for binary classification of handwritten digits using TensorFlow.
- Gain a deeper understanding by implementing a neural network in Python from scratch.
- Optionally learn how neural network computations are “vectorized” to use parallel processing for faster training and prediction.

### [Week 2](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Course2/Week2)
- Build a neural network to perform multi-class classification of handwritten digits in TensorFlow, using categorical cross-entropy loss functions and the softmax activation.
- Learn where to use different activation functions (ReLu, linear, sigmoid, softmax) in a neural network, depending on the task you want your model to perform.
- Use the advanced “Adam optimizer” to train your model more efficiently.

### [Week 3](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Course2/Week3)
- Discover the value of separating your data set into training, cross-validation, and test sets.
- Choose from various versions of your model using a cross-validation dataset, and evaluate its ability to generalize to real-world data using a test dataset.
- Use “learning curves” to determine if your model is experiencing high bias or high variance (or both), and learn which techniques to apply (regularization, adding more data, adding or removing input features) to improve your model’s performance.
- Learn how the “bias-variance trade-off” is different in the age of deep learning, and apply Andrew Ng’s advice for handling bias and variance when training neural networks.
- Learn to apply the “iterative loop” of machine learning development to train, evaluate, and tune your model.
- Apply “data-centric AI” to not only tune your model but tune your data (using data synthesis or data augmentation) to improve your model’s performance.

### [Week 4](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Course2/Week4)
- Build decision trees and tree ensembles, such as random forest and XGBoost (boosted trees) to make predictions.
- Learn when to use neural network or tree ensemble models for your task, as these are the two most commonly used supervised learning models in practice today.

## [Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/unsupervised-learning-recommenders-reinforcement-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
