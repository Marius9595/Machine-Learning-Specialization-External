#BreakIntoAI with Machine Learning Specialization. Master fundamental AI concepts and develop practical machine learning skills in the beginner-friendly, 3-course program by AI visionary Andrew Ng

## [Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)
If you want to break into cutting-edge AI, this course will help you do so. Deep learning engineers are highly sought after, and mastering deep learning will give you numerous new career opportunities. Deep learning is also a new “superpower” that will let you build AI systems that just weren’t possible a few years ago.

### In the first course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:
- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear regression and logistic regression

### [Week 1](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Course1/Week1)
- Learn the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning and regression and classification tasks.
- Build a linear regression model.
- Implement and understand the purpose of a cost function.
- Implement and understand how gradient descent is used to train a machine learning model.

#### Optional Lab

> #### [1. Python and Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/Course1/Week1/C1_W1_Lab01_Python_Jupyter_Soln.ipynb)
>> In this lab, you will explore some of the tools that are used in this course. Python and Jupyter notebooks.

> #### [2. Model representation](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/Course1/Week1/C1_W1_Lab03_Model_Representation_Soln.ipynb)
>> In this ungraded lab, you can see how a linear regression model is defined in code, and you can see plots that show how well a model fits some data given choices of w and b.  You can also try different values of w and b to see if it improves the fit to the data.

> #### [3. Cost function](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/Course1/Week1/C1_W1_Lab04_Cost_function_Soln.ipynb)
>> This optional lab will show you how the cost function is implemented in code. And given a small training set and different choices for the parameters you’ll be able to see how the cost varies depending on how well the model fits the data. 

>> In the optional lab, you'll also get to play with an interactive contour plot.  You can use your mouse cursor to click anywhere on the contour plot, and you see the straight line defined by the values you chose, for parameters w and b.

>> Finally the optional lab also has a 3d surface plot that you can manually rotate and spin around, using your mouse cursor, to take a better look at what the cost function looks like.

> #### [4. Gradient descent](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/Course1/Week1/C1_W1_Lab05_Gradient_Descent_Soln.ipynb)
>> In the optional lab, you’ll see a review of the gradient descent algorithm, as well as how to implement it in code.

>> You will also see a plot that shows how the cost decreases as you continue training more iterations.  And you’ll also see a contour plot, seeing how the cost gets closer to the global minimum as gradient descent finds better and better values for the parameters w and b.

### [Week 2](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Course1/Week2)
- Build and train a regression model that takes multiple features as input (multiple linear regression).
- Implement and understand the cost function and gradient descent for multiple linear regression.
- Implement and understand methods for improving machine learning models by choosing the learning rate, plotting the learning curve, performing feature engineering, and - applying polynomial regression.

### [Week 3](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Course1/Week3)
- Implement and understand the logistic regression model for classification.
- Learn why logistic regression is better suited for classification tasks than the linear regression model is.
- Implement and understand the cost function and gradient descent for logistic regression.
- Understand the problem of “overfitting” and improve model performance using regularization.
- Implement regularization to improve both regression and classification models.

### In the second course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:
- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification.
- Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world.

- Gain a deeper understanding by implementing a neural network in Python from scratch.
- Optionally learn how neural network computations are “vectorized” to use parallel processing for faster training and prediction.

### [Week 2](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Course2/Week2)
- Build a neural network to perform multi-class classification of handwritten digits in TensorFlow, using categorical cross-entropy loss functions and the softmax activation.
- Learn where to use different activation functions (ReLu, linear, sigmoid, softmax) in a neural network, depending on the task you want your model to perform.
- Use the advanced “Adam optimizer” to train your model more efficiently.

### [Week 3](https://github.com/kawamura-R/Machine-Learning-Specialization/tree/main/Course2/Week3)
- Discover the value of separating your data set into training, cross-validation, and test sets.
- Choose from various versions of your model using a cross-validation dataset, and evaluate its ability to generalize to real-world data using a test dataset.
- Use “learning curves” to determine if your model is experiencing high bias or high variance (or both), and learn which techniques to apply (regularization, adding more data, adding or removing input features) to improve your model’s performance.
- Learn how the “bias-variance trade-off” is different in the age of deep learning, and apply Andrew Ng’s advice for handling bias and variance when training neural networks.
- Learn to apply the “iterative loop” of machine learning development to train, evaluate, and tune your model.
- Apply “data-centric AI” to not only tune your model but tune your data (using data synthesis or data augmentation) to improve your model’s performance.
